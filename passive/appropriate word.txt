none of these → Only choose if all other options are wrong.

can't → Means "You are not allowed to."

"You can't make so much noise." → Grammatically correct, but it implies inability or prohibition by external rules.

mustn't → Means "It is forbidden."

"You mustn't make so much noise." → Perfect! Expresses prohibition clearly.
