1)Two vessels contain milk and water in the ratio 3:2 and 7:3. Find the ratio in which the contents of the two vessels to be mixed to get a new mixture in which the ratio of milk and water is 2:1.

2 : 1
4 : 1
1 : 2
1 : 4

Milk       :      Water
Vessel A       3        :       2
Vessel B       7        :       3

Now using alligation,
Vessel 1          :          Vessel 2
 3/5 -- 2+3                               7/10 -- 7+3
The required final mixture ratio is:
â€ƒâ€ƒMilk : Water = 2 : 1

So, the total parts = 2 + 1 = 3 parts.

Therefore, the fraction of milk in the final mixture is:

TotalÂ parts = 3
MilkÂ parts = 2
ğŸ‘‰ So,
â€ƒâ€ƒFraction of milk = 2/3 --- 
(7/10-2/3)=1/30                  (2/3-3/5)=1/15

    1                 :               2
