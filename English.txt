🧠 ONE-LINE MEMORY TRICK (VERY IMPORTANT)
---------
Present → V1
Past → V2
Future → will + V1
had → V3




Verbs 
are action words

v- action ---> ex: waving, singing
   state ---> ex: loving, hating, impressing, agreeing
   occurence ---> ex: are, am, was, had

⚠️ Exam trap

✔ YES → Use V3
❌ NO → Don’t use V3
-------------====
❌ She has went
✅ She has gone 

❌ The work is do
✅ The work is done

❌ He did gone home
✅ He did go home

❌ She written the exam yesterday
✅ She wrote the exam yesterday

❌ The letter was wrote
✅ The letter was written

❌ She is write a letter
✅ She is writing a letter




🔑 REMEMBER THESE GOLDEN RULES

1️⃣ has / have / had → V3
2️⃣ is / was / were → V3 (passive)
3️⃣ did → V1
4️⃣ V4 (-ing) is used only with is/am/are for action in progress

Got it 👍
This is **very important clarity**, Vaishnavi — thanks for saying it clearly.

👉 **You remember verb forms (V1–V2–V3)**
👉 **You do NOT remember tense structures**

So now we will **NOT touch meanings or rules**,
we will only focus on **STRUCTURE MEMORY** (patterns).

---

# 🔑 TENSE STRUCTURES (ONLY WHAT YOU NEED)

Think of tenses like **formulas**, not grammar.

---

## 1️⃣ Simple Present — STRUCTURE

### 👉 Affirmative

```
Subject + V1 (+ s/es for he/she/it)
```

Examples:

* I **go** to college.
* She **goes** to college.

### 👉 Negative

```
Subject + do/does + not + V1
```

* I **do not go**
* She **does not go**

### 👉 Question

```
Do/Does + subject + V1 ?
```

* Do you go?
* Does she go?

---

## 2️⃣ Simple Past — STRUCTURE

### 👉 Affirmative

```
Subject + V2
```

* I **went** home.

### 👉 Negative

```
Subject + did not + V1
```

* I **did not go** home.

### 👉 Question

```
Did + subject + V1 ?
```

* Did you go home?

⚠️ Rule you must remember:
❌ did + V2 (wrong)
✅ did + V1 (correct)

---

## 3️⃣ Simple Future — STRUCTURE

### 👉 Affirmative

```
Subject + will + V1
```

* I **will go** home.

### 👉 Negative

```
Subject + will not + V1
```

* I **will not go** home.

### 👉 Question

```
Will + subject + V1 ?
```

* Will you go home?

---

## 4️⃣ Past Perfect (HAD) — STRUCTURE

### 👉 Affirmative

```
Subject + had + V3
```

* I **had gone** home.

### 👉 Negative

```
Subject + had not + V3
```

* I **had not gone** home.

### 👉 Question

```
Had + subject + V3 ?
```

* Had you gone home?

---

## 🧠 ONE-LINE MEMORY TRICK (VERY IMPORTANT)

* **Present** → V1
* **Past** → V2
* **Future** → will + V1
* **had** → V3



mistakes you did 
-----------------
3️⃣ ___ they play cricket daily?

❌ will
✅ do

👉 Rule:

Daily / habit → present
Present questions → do / does
Correct sentence:
Do they play cricket daily?


1️⃣ She ___ not go yesterday.

❌ does
✅ did

👉 Reason (structure):
Past time word yesterday → did not + V1

Correct sentence:

She did not go yesterday.
