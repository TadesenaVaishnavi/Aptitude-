1) The ages of Frank Forde and Ben Chifley differ by 16 years. 6 years ago, Frank Forde was 3 times as old as Ben Chifley. What is the present age of Frank Forde?

30
20
25
15

answer -- 30
Let's take the present age of the elder person = x 
and the present age of the younger person = x – 16
(x – 6) = 3 (x-16-6)
=> x – 6 = 3x – 66
=> 2x = 60
=> x = 60/2 = 30
