1) The ages of Frank Forde and Ben Chifley differ by 16 years. 6 years ago, Frank Forde was 3 times as old as Ben Chifley. What is the present age of Frank Forde?

30
20
25
15

answer -- 30
Let's take the present age of the elder person = x 
and the present age of the younger person = x – 16
(x – 6) = 3 (x-16-6)
=> x – 6 = 3x – 66
=> 2x = 60
=> x = 60/2 = 30


2) Ten years ago, John Curtin was thrice as old as Joseph Cook was. But 10 years hence, he will be only twice as old. Find John Curtin's present age.

80 years
70 years
60 years
76 years

answer -- 70 years


Let John's present age be x years and Joseph's present age be y years.
Then, according to the first condition,x-10=3(y-10)
=> x-3y=-20
Now, John's age after 10 years = (x+10) years
Joseph's age after 10 years=(y+10) years(x+10)=2(y+10)
=> x-2y=10
x=70 and y=30
John's age=70 years.
