What least value should be given to * so that the number 145*603 is exactly divisible by 9?

2
5
8
7


Ans: 8

Solution 1:
A number will be divisible by 9 if the sum of digits of that number is divisible by 9. 
∴ for this number, 1 + 4 + 5 + * + 6 + 0 + 3 = 19 + * 
∴ 19 + * = 27. (next number divisible by 9 after 18).
Hence, * = 8.
