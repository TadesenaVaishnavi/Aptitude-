1) Anju, Manju, and Sanju together can reap a field in 6 days. If Anju can do it alone in 10 days and Manju in 24 days. In how many days will Sanju alone be able to reap the field?

35 days
32 days
40 days
36 days

answer -- 40 
explaination --
Anju+ Manju+ Sanju = 6 days
Anju = 10 days
Manju= 24 days
LCM= Total work= 120 units
Efficiency of Anju+ Manju+ Sanju= 120/6= 20 units/day
Efficiency of Anju = 120/10= 12 units/day
Efficiency of Manju= 120/24= 5 units/day
Efficiency of Sanju= 20-12-5= 3 units/day
Sanju can complete the work in 120/3= 40 days
