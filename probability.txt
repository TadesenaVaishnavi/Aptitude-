NOTE :
Multiplication (*) -- ðŸ‘‰ Use multiplication when calculating the probability of both events happening together (AND rule).
*** If A and B are independent (the outcome of A doesnâ€™t affect B)

Addition (+) -- ðŸ‘‰ Case A: Use addition when calculating the probability of either event happening (OR rule).
*** If the events are mutually exclusive (they cannot happen at the same time):

Case B: If the events are not mutually exclusive (can happen together):
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)



1) In how many ways can 7 beads be strung into a necklace?

2520
5040
720
360

Answer: 360

Solution 1:
n = 7
For circular arrangement,
number of arrangement = (n-1)! = 6!
since the necklace can be clockwise or anticlockwise
6!/2 = 360
